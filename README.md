Draw your imagination of this game. What does this game look like?
●	Draw the game either on your computer or on paper, 
●	Add images of scenes of the game to show each of the playing and non-playing characters at least once.  

Space background, the alien ships will spawn in from the right side and the player ship will be on the right side. Alien ships will also move from the right to the left side.
 
How do you plan to make your game engaging? 

The player ships and the alien ships will both get upgrades as the player gets more kills. With the upgrades, the game will become more challenging for the player and will keep the player interested and engaged.
